# Fractional Ownership for Trading Cards using Intercom

What if you could own a fraction of a rare trading card—for as little as $10?

This project explores how real-world collectibles like Pokémon, sports cards, or other high-value trading cards can become shared, peer-to-peer owned assets. Instead of relying on centralized platforms, ownership, communication, and trading happen directly between participants using Intercom’s decentralized infrastructure.

Each card becomes its own digital coordination space where holders can:

* own fractions of the asset
* trade shares directly with others
* coordinate decisions (e.g. sell, hold, auction)
* communicate peer-to-peer without intermediaries

This lowers the barrier to entry for collectors and investors, and enables new forms of shared ownership around real-world assets.

# Why Intercom

Intercom provides a peer-to-peer networking stack designed for an “internet of agents,” enabling secure communication, shared state, and optional value transfer without centralized servers.

By combining Intercom with fractional ownership logic, each trading card becomes:

* a **peer-to-peer asset channel**
* a **replicated ownership state** managed by contracts
* a **coordination layer** for holders
* a **marketplace without a platform**

This means the asset itself becomes the platform.

# Concept Overview

Each trading card is represented as:

**1. Asset Channel (Sidechannel)**
A dedicated Intercom sidechannel for real-time communication and coordination between holders.

**2. Ownership Contract (Subnet plane)**
A deterministic replicated state storing:

* total shares
* ownership distribution
* transfer history

**3. Peer-to-Peer Trading**
Participants can transfer ownership directly, without centralized custody.

**4. Optional Settlement Layer**
Value transfer can be integrated using crypto settlement if required.

# Goals of this Repository

This fork serves as an experimental foundation to explore:

* Fractional ownership of real-world collectibles
* Peer-to-peer asset coordination
* Decentralized asset communities
* Agent-native ownership and trading models

---

# Vision

Fractional ownership will transform how real-world assets are owned and traded.

Trading cards are the ideal starting point:

* highly liquid
* globally recognized
* culturally significant
* crypto-native audience

This project is a step toward a future where any real-world asset can exist as a peer-to-peer owned, digitally coordinated entity.
